# IoT LoRaWan FahradSchloss
IoT Fahradschloww tracker über LoRaWan Free Network

## Backend and frontend Web Application
A backend and frontend application have been developed to track and control the ``ÌoT FahradSchloss``.
The application have been developed with the python frame work Django o top of a SQLite Database and linked to the MQTT API of "The Things Network" which provides
access to all devices connected through LoRaWan.

## IoT device: TTGO LORA32

The IoT device ``TTGO LORA32`` is an Arduino compatible microcontroller, that can be programmed and flushed using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
Here are some exampoles codes that may help you to get in touch with this topic:
